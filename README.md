# Possible Solutions to Improve the Accuracy of Laser Therapy in Removing Tumors

We will be looking into the potential solutions to address the accuracy issues in laser therapy specifically in the removal of tumors caused by the use of square pixels in medical imaging. The reason we picked this topic is because lasers are playing an increasing role in early detection cancer diagnosis and other treatment applications. Lasers have many advantages over conventional light sources used in optical imaging such as the availability of higher powers at wavelengths ranging from UV to Mid-IR. Another advantage using laser therapy is the beam quality which allows for high spatial resolution imaging as well as high repetition rate that  allows for fast image generation. Laser treatment also allows the availability of ultrashort femtosecond pulses for real-time studies of molecular and subcellular dynamics. In an ever changing, fast paced, technological world, laser therapy can always be more accurate, more cost effective, and eco-friendly.
